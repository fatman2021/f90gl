This file describes the naming convention for the makefiles (mf*) and
include files for the preprocessor (fppincs/fpp*).

In some cases a common makefile handles many systems; this is called mfmost.
In fppincs, there is a fppmesa that is used by several of the systems with Mesa.

Otherwise, the naming convention for makefiles is mf12345 and preprocessor
files is fpp12345 where
