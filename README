This is f90gl Version 1.2.15

f90gl is a public domain implementation of the official Fortran 90 bindings
for OpenGL and GLU, and the application of those bindings to GLUT.

For installation instructions, see INSTALL.

For user information, see USRGUIDE and examples/README.

NOTE: Both INSTALL and USRGUIDE contain information about exceptions for
      particular system configurations

FORTRAN 77

This version of f90gl is an implementation of the Fortran 90 bindings to
OpenGL and does not contain the FORTRAN 77 interfaces.  If you need FORTRAN 77
interfaces, then

  1) If you are using a commercial implementation of OpenGL, see if it contains
     the FORTRAN 77 interfaces.  Most should.

  2) If you are using MESA or your commercial OpenGL does not contain
     FORTRAN 77 interfaces, then get f90gl Version 1.0 from the f90gl home
     page at http://math.nist.gov/f90gl.  This contains FORTRAN 77 interfaces
     for OpenGL Version 1.0, GLU, and some extensions.  No version of f90gl has
     FORTRAN 77 interfaces for the additional routines in OpenGL 1.1 and 1.2.

  3) If you need FORTRAN 77 interfaces for GLUT, get f90gl Version 1.0.

  4) If you need either Fortran 90 or FORTRAN 77 interfaces for tk, get
     f90gl Version 1.0.

In any of these cases, you can build some libraries with f90gl Version 1.0
and some with the current version of f90gl.
