This directory contains the example programs translated to the F and ELF90
subset language syntax.

You might have to make a symbolic link in this directory to include/GL for ELF

ELF90 notes:
------------

These were tested using Lahey's precompiled f90gl libraries for LF90.

glutdino crashes.

scube cannot be built because ELF90 does not have 1-byte integers, and
the precompiled f90gl library for LF90 does.

some of the new examples were translated to F but not checked for ELF90

F notes:
--------

scube draws in the wrong colors, possibly a mistake in relating one byte
integers to C's unsigned byte

the postscript file created by eps has a few dark spots due to not sorting
