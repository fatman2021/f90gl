This directory contains a few utilities.

trans10 -- this is a sed script that converts applications using the "old"
           Fortran 90 interface to OpenGL (used in f90gl version 1.0) to
           the "new" interface used in f90gl version 1.1 and later.  Read
           the file for instructions on using it and what it will and will
           not do.  See also the Upgrading section of f90gl/USRGUIDE.  And
           PLEASE backup any files to which you apply trans10.

findsize.c -- this is a short C program that prints the size of the C types
              interfaced by f90gl.  It can be useful to determine the correct
              settings for the kind type parameters in glkinds.f90, but there
              will be very few people that need to do this.
           
sppr.f90 -- a simple preprocessor used for conditional compilation in f90gl.
            This in NOT a general purpose preprocessor.  Do not try to use it
            for any other purpose -- it'll bite you!
            If you need a general purpose preprocessor for Fortran 90, get
            Michel Olagnon's f90ppr from
            http://www.ifremer.fr/ditigo/molagnon/fortran90/contenu.html
